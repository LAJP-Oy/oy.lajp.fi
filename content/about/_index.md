I run LAJP Oy, a one-person software consulting company based in Espoo, Finland.

## What I Do

I build backend systems, embedded software, and infrastructure. 10 years of programming experience.

**Backend Development** — Web APIs, async services, data pipelines. Rust since 2020 (tokio, axum, actix, tonic, sqlx, diesel), but I adapt to what the project needs.

**Embedded & Systems** — Linux on ARM, firmware, cross-compilation. Building reliable software for constrained environments and custom hardware.

**Infrastructure** — CI/CD, reproducible builds, deployment pipelines, dev environments. Deep expertise in Nix (flakes, NixOS, cross-compilation), also experienced with Terraform and Docker.

## Approach

I specialize in Rust and Nix because they let me build systems that are fast, correct, and reproducible. But tools serve the problem, not the other way around. I pick up what's needed and deliver working software.
